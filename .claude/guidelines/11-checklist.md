# Pre-Generation Checklist

> Verify before committing or submitting code.

---

## PHP & Standards

| Check | Verify |
|-------|--------|
| PHP Version | Minimum 8.0 declared in plugin header and composer.json |
| PHP Features | Features above 8.0 documented with `@requires PHP 8.1` |
| Strict Types | `declare(strict_types=1)` in every file |
| Typing | All params/returns typed, PHPDoc complete |
| Modern PHP | Constructor promotion, match, union types, enums used |
| Standards | WPCS followed, tabs for indentation |

---

## Naming & Prefixes

| Check | Verify |
|-------|--------|
| Slug Unique | Plugin slug registered in registry table; no collision |
| Constants | Only `NVM_{SLUG}_FILE` and `NVM_{SLUG}_PATH` as globals |
| Class Constants | All others in `Plugin` class |
| Namespace | `NVM\{Plugin}\` matches the registered slug |
| Hooks | All hooks prefixed with `nvm/{plugin-slug}/` |
| Prefix | Options, transients, meta keys, nonces use `Plugin::PREFIX` |
| DB Tables | Custom tables use `{$wpdb->prefix}nvm_{slug}_` |
| REST Routes | Namespace is `nvm/{plugin-slug}/v1` |
| Script Handles | Format: `nvm-{plugin-slug}-{purpose}` |

---

## Security

| Check | Verify |
|-------|--------|
| Input Sanitized | All `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST` sanitized |
| Output Escaped | All output uses `esc_html`, `esc_attr`, `esc_url` |
| Nonces | All forms and AJAX use nonces with `Plugin::PREFIX` |
| Capabilities | `current_user_can()` before sensitive operations |
| ABSPATH Check | Every PHP file starts with ABSPATH check |
| REST Permissions | `permission_callback` is never `__return_true` |
| SQL | `$wpdb->prepare()` for any direct SQL |

---

## WooCommerce

| Check | Verify |
|-------|--------|
| CRUD Classes | Using `wc_get_product()`, `wc_get_order()` — no direct SQL |
| HPOS Declared | Plugin declares HPOS compatibility |
| No Direct SQL | Never query `wp_posts`/`wp_postmeta` for orders |
| Block Checkout | Considered if extending checkout |

---

## Performance

| Check | Verify |
|-------|--------|
| Conditional Loading | Assets only load on needed pages |
| Script Strategy | Using `defer` or `async` for scripts |
| Action Scheduler | Heavy tasks (> 2s) are async |
| Caching | Expensive operations cached with prefix |
| Cache Invalidation | Every write operation invalidates caches |
| Query Limits | All `wc_get_orders()`/`wc_get_products()` have `limit` |
| Object Cache | Per-request data uses `wp_cache_*` |

---

## JavaScript

| Check | Verify |
|-------|--------|
| Frontend | Vanilla JS with `fetch()`, no jQuery dependency |
| Admin | jQuery acceptable |
| Data Passing | `wp_add_inline_script` for config data |
| i18n | `wp_localize_script` only for translatable strings |

---

## Quality & Testing (Mandatory)

**All tests must be executed and passing before commit. No exceptions.**

| Check | Command | Verify |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Code Style + Compat | `composer cs` | WPCS + PHPCompatibilityWP (`testVersion 8.0-`) clean |
| Unit Tests Run | `composer test` | All unit tests pass (exit code 0) |
| Unit Tests Exist | — | Every service, handler, controller, enum has tests |
| Coverage Gate | `composer coverage:check` | ≥ 80% line coverage on `src/Services/` |
| Mutation Score | `vendor/bin/infection` | MSI ≥ 70, covered MSI ≥ 80 (CI; see `09-testing.md`) |
| Integration Tests | `phpunit -c phpunit-integration.xml` | Hook wiring, CRUD round-trips, `$wpdb` code covered |
| E2E Tests Run | `npm run test:e2e` | All Playwright tests pass (if E2E tests exist) |
| E2E Tests Exist | — | Shopper flows, merchant flows, `/wc/v3` + Store API covered |
| Accessibility | axe specs in E2E suite | No serious/critical violations on screens the plugin touches |
| PHPStan | `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` | Level 8 (new projects) passes; baseline only shrinks |
| Plugin Check | `wp plugin check <slug>` | No ERROR-level findings |
| Bug Fixes | — | Every bug fix has a failing test written BEFORE the fix |
| Edge Cases | — | Zero, negative, null, empty, max, UTF-8, duplicates covered |
| Dependencies | — | WooCommerce version check with admin notice fallback |

Full gate order and CI enforcement: `17-quality-gates.md`.

### Test Execution Order

```bash
# 1. Code style + PHP compatibility (fastest)
composer cs

# 2. Static analysis
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse

# 3. Unit tests + coverage gate
composer test
composer coverage:check

# 4. Integration + E2E tests (slower, run last — ask user first)
npx wp-env run tests-cli --env-cwd=wp-content/plugins/<slug> vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit-integration.xml
npm run test:e2e
```

### If Tests Fail

- **Do not commit.** Fix the failing test first.
- If a test fails unexpectedly, investigate the root cause — don't just skip or delete the test.
- If E2E tests fail due to environment issues, notify the user and document the issue.

## Lifecycle & Migrations

Only when the plugin creates tables, options, scheduled tasks, or ships a schema
change. Full rules: `18-lifecycle-migrations.md`.

| Check | Verify |
|-------|--------|
| Migration runner | Hooked to `admin_init`, not the activation hook alone |
| Schema version | Own option, separate from `Plugin::VERSION`, `$autoload` false |
| Checkpointing | Version written after each migration, not once at the end |
| Idempotency | Every migration safe to run twice |
| Shipped migrations | Never edited or reordered after release |
| `dbDelta` format | Two spaces after `PRIMARY KEY`, `KEY` not `INDEX`, lowercase types |
| Column drop/rename | Explicit `ALTER`, guarded by an existence check |
| Large backfills | Action Scheduler batches, never one request |
| Activation defaults | `add_option()`, so reactivation preserves settings |
| Rewrite flush | Deferred to `init` via a flag, never called in activation |
| Multisite | Activation and uninstall loop `get_sites()` |
| Deactivation | Unschedules and clears caches only; destroys no data |
| `uninstall.php` | `WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN` guard, capability check, opt-in setting |
| Uninstall sweep | `esc_like()` on prefixes, tables dropped, network options cleared |

---

## Build

| Check | Verify |
|-------|--------|
| Build Script (Mac/Linux) | `build.sh` exists and is executable (`chmod +x build.sh`) |
| Build Script (Windows) | `build.ps1` exists for native Windows support |
| Build Command | `./build.sh` or `.\build.ps1` creates `dist/` folder with plugin zip |
| No Dev Dependencies | Production `vendor/` has no dev packages |
| Excluded | `tests/`, `phpunit.xml`, `phpstan.neon`, `.git/`, `node_modules/` not in build |
| Zip Created | `dist/{plugin-slug}.zip` ready for upload |
